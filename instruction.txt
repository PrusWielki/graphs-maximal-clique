A prerequisite is a Windows machine with gcc installed. Preferably 64-bit.

The simplest way to compile is the following:
1. Open cmd and navigate to the Source folder.
2. Type compile.bat and press enter.
3. A compiled executable will appear in the same folder.
4. Then the examples can be run by for example:
    main.exe ../Examples/example1.txt

To run one of the examples located in Examples folder with the use of precompiled executable:
1. Open cmd and navigate to folder with executables.
2. Run the executable with example file (examples are located in the "Examples" folder), assuming one is in the folder with executables:
    main.exe ../Examples/example1.txt
3. Output of the program will be presented in command line and in output.txt file

Alternatively to compile the program and run it manually:
1. Open cmd and navigate to folder with source code.
2. Compile the program:
    gcc main.c -o main
3. An executable will appear in the same folder.
3. Run the executable with example file (examples are located in the "Examples" folder)
    main.exe ../Examples/example1.txt
4. Output of the program will be presented in command line and in output.txt file

The program accepts multiple input files and multiple input graphs in each file:
    main.exe ../Examples/example1.txt ../Examples/example2.txt
