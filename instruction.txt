A prerequisite is a Windows machine with gcc installed. Preferably 64-bit.

1. Open cmd and navigate to folder with executables.
2. Run the executable with example file (examples are located in the "input" folder)
    main.exe ./input/example.txt

Alternatively to compile the program and run it:
1. Open cmd and navigate to folder with executables.
2. Compile the program:
    gcc main.c -o main
2. Run the executable with example file (examples are located in the "input" folder)
    main.exe ./input/example.txt

The program accepts multiple input files and multiple input graphs in each file:
    main.exe ./input/example.txt ./input/example.txt
