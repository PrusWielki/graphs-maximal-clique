A prerequisite is a Windows machine with gcc installed. Preferably 64-bit.

1. Open cmd and navigate to folder with executables.
2. Run the executable with example file (examples are located in the "Examples" folder), assuming one is in the folder with executables:
    main.exe ../Examples/example.txt
3. Output of the program will be presented in command line and in output.txt file

Alternatively to compile the program and run it:
1. Open cmd and navigate to folder with source code.
2. Compile the program:
    gcc main.c -o main
3. Run the executable with example file (examples are located in the "Examples" folder)
    main.exe ../Examples/example.txt
4. Output of the program will be presented in command line and in output.txt file

The program accepts multiple input files and multiple input graphs in each file:
    main.exe ../Examples/example.txt ../Examples/example.txt
