# How to compile
```gcc main.c graph.c -o main```
# How to run with example file
``` ./main input/example.txt```

# TODO
- [x] Write data parsing from file in agreed format.
- [ ] Prepare some example data (reasonable amount). Preferably with known answers to cross-check.
- [ ] Write a function to find a product of matrices.
- [ ] Write a function to find maximal cliques of matrices (Bronn Kerbosch probably).
